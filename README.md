This is a Music Theory App (get it?). 

# How To Use It

Click Play to hear the interval. You can hear it as many times as you want. When you think you have the answer, 
click on "Hide/Show Answer." You can keep the answer window open or closed. Click on "New Interval" to get a new 
interval. You can click on buttons while intervals are being played, and mostly nothing bad happens, but once in 
a while there are glitches with the sound.
